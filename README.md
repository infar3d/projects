# PROJECTS:

- **AntsVsSomeBees (Python)**: tower defense game created using Python, inspired by Plants vs. Zombies. Ants must protect their queen ant from bees invading their territory. Can be played using GUI.

Implemented an HUD (which allows you to see tile type), ability to choose avatar, replay game (displays all moves of the last game), and a play-from-last-game feature (starts the game from where the last one ended). Rendered the game with StdDraw.
- **CATS** aka **C**S61A **A**utocorrected **T**yping **S**oftware (Python): A program that measures typing speed and accuracy, with the option of enabling autocorrect. Compliled data about frequency of English words to implement the autocorrect feature.

   - 1A: Implemented a Doubly Linnked List representation of a Deque.
   - 1B: Impelmented the ArrayDeque
   - 1C: Implemented a MaxArrayDeque which keeps track of the max item.
- **Scheme_Interpreter (Python)**: an interpretor for a subset of the Scheme language that takes in an expression in the scheme language, interprets in Python, and displays the result. Can interpret math proceduces, user-defined functions, lambda functions, as well as logical special forms (if, or, and, cond).
