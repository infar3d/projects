# PROJECTS: 
----------------------------------------------
- AntsVsSomeBees: tower defense game created using Python, inspired by Plants vs. Zombies. Ants must protect their queen ant from bees invading their territory. Can be played using GUI. (Python)
- BuildYourOwnWorld: personal game that renders a unique world based on seed, where avatar moves around. Implemented an HUD (which allows you to see tile type), ability to choose avatar, replay game (displays all moves of the last game), and a play-from-last-game feature (starts the game from where the last one ended). Rendered the game with StdDraw. (Java)
- CATS (CS61A Autocorrected Typing Software): A program that measures typing speed and accuracy, with the option of enabling autocorrect. Compliled data about frequency of English words to implement the autocorrect feature. (Python)
